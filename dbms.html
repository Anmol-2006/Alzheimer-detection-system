        <h2 class="heading">Overview</h2>
        <p class="para">Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. Alzheimer's disease is the biological process that begins with the appearance of a buildup of proteins in the form of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. This causes brain cells to die over time and the brain to shrink.</p>
        <p class="para">About 6.9 million people in the United States age 65 and older live with Alzheimer's disease. Among them, more than 70% are age 75 and older. Of the more than 55 million people in the world with dementia, 60% to 70% are estimated to have Alzheimer's disease.</p>
        <p class="para">Early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease include forgetting recent events or conversations. Over time, Alzheimer's disease leads to serious memory loss and affects a person's ability to do everyday tasks.</p>
        <p class="para">There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease. In advanced stages, loss of brain function can cause dehydration, poor nutrition or infection. These complications can result in death.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 class="heading" id="para1">Symptoms</h2>
        <p class="para">Memory loss is the key symptom of Alzheimer's disease. Early in the disease, people may have trouble remembering recent events or conversations. Over time, memory gets worse and other symptoms occur.</p>
        <p class="para">At first, someone with the disease may be aware of having trouble remembering things and thinking clearly. As signs and symptoms get worse, a family member or friend may be more likely to notice the issues.</p>
        <p class="para">Brain changes from Alzheimer's disease lead to the following symptoms that get worse over time.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 class="heading" id="para3">Causes</h2>
        <img src="https://www.mayoclinic.org/-/media/kcms/gbs/patient-consumer/images/2023/02/01/20/24/healthy-brain-and-brain-with-alzheimers-8-col-3398230-002-0.jpg" class= "image" />
        <p class="para">The exact causes of Alzheimer's disease aren't fully understood. But at a basic level, brain proteins don't function as usual. This disrupts the work of brain cells, also known as neurons, and triggers a series of events. The neurons become damaged and lose connections to each other. They eventually die.</p>
        <p class="para">Scientists believe that for most people, Alzheimer's disease is caused by a combination of genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors that affect the brain over time. In less than 1% of people, Alzheimer's is caused by specific genetic changes that almost guarantee a person will develop the disease. For people in this group, the disease usually begins in middle age.</p>
        <ul class="para">
          <li><strong>Plaques</strong>: Beta-amyloid is a fragment of a larger protein. When these fragments clump together, they affect communication between brain cells. The clumps form larger deposits called amyloid plaques.</li>
          <li><strong>Tangles</strong>: Tau proteins play a part in a brain cell's internal support and transport system to carry nutrients and other essential materials. In Alzheimer's disease, tau proteins change mshape and organize into structures called neurofibrillary tangles. The tangles disrupt the transport system and cause damage to cells.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 class="heading" id="para2">Memory loss</h2>
        <p class="para">Everyone has trouble with memory at times, but the memory loss related to Alzheimer's disease is lasting. Over time, memory loss affects the ability to function at work and at home.</p>
        <ul class="para">
          <li>Repeat statements and questions over and over.</li>
          <li>Forget conversations, appointments or events.</li>
          <li>Misplace items, often putting them in places that don't make sense.</li>
          <li>Get lost in places they used to know well.</li>
          <li>Forget the names of family members and everyday objects.</li>
          <li>Have trouble finding the right words, expressing thoughts or having conversations.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 class="heading">Thinking and reasoning</h2>
        <p class="para">Alzheimer's disease causes trouble concentrating and thinking, especially about abstract concepts such as numbers. Doing more than one task at once is especially hard. It may be challenging to manage finances, balance checkbooks and pay bills on time. Eventually people with Alzheimer's disease may not recognize numbers.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 class="heading">Changes in personality and behavior</h2>
        <ul class="para" >Brain changes that occur in Alzheimer's disease can affect moods and behaviors. Symptoms may include :-
          <li>Depression</li>
          <li>Loss of interest</li>
          <li>Mood swings</li>
          <li>Not trusting others</li>
          <li>Anger or aggression</li>
          <li>Changes in sleeping habits</li>
          <li>Wandering</li>
          <li>Loss of inhibitions</li>
          <li>Delusions, such as believing something has been stolen when it hasn't.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2 class="heading">When to see a doctor</h2>
        <p class="para">Several conditions can cause memory loss or other dementia symptoms. Some of those conditions can be treated. If you are concerned about your memory or other thinking skills, talk to your healthcare professional.</p>
