            Symptoms
Memory loss is the key symptom of Alzheimer's disease. Early in the disease, people may have trouble remembering recent events or conversations. Over time, memory gets worse and other symptoms occur.

At first, someone with the disease may be aware of having trouble remembering things and thinking clearly. As signs and symptoms get worse, a family member or friend may be more likely to notice the issues.

Brain changes from Alzheimer's disease lead to the following symptoms that get worse over time.
