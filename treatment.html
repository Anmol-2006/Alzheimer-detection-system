          <p class="para">An important part of diagnosing Alzheimer's disease includes being able to explain your symptoms. It may help to get input from a close family member or friend about your symptoms and their impact on your daily life. Tests of memory and thinking skills also help diagnose Alzheimer's disease.</p>

      <p class="para">Blood and imaging tests can rule out other potential causes of your symptoms. They also can check for proteins in the brain that are linked to Alzheimer's disease. The tests may help your healthcare team better identify the disease causing dementia symptoms.</p>
      <p class="para">In the past, Alzheimer's disease was diagnosed for certain only after death when plaques and tangles were found while looking at the brain with a microscope. Today, healthcare professionals and researchers are able to diagnose Alzheimer's disease during life with more certainty.</p>
      <p class="para">They do this by using a combination of tests that may include tests for biomarkers. Biomarkers can detect if plaques and tangles are present in the brain. Biomarker tests include specific types of positron emission tomography, also known as PET, scans of the brain. Amyloid and tau proteins also can be measured in the fluid part of the blood or in the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, known as cerebrospinal fluid. Recently, blood biomarker tests have become accurate enough to tell if someone is likely to have amyloid in the brain.</p>
      <p class="para">Biomarker tests were mainly used in clinical trials until recently. But healthcare professionals have started using them along with other tests to help diagnose Alzheimer's disease. Biomarker tests also can let healthcare professionals know if the disease is in the early or later stages.</p>

      <p class="para">Diagnosing Alzheimer's disease would likely include the following tests:</p>
      <div class="physical tests">
        <h2>⦿ A healthcare professional gives you a physical and neurological exam.</h2>
        <ul>
          <li class="li">Reflexes.</li>
          <li class="li">Muscle tone and strength.</li>
          <li class="li">Ability to get up from a chair and walk across the room.</li>

          <p class="para">Blood tests may help rule out other potential causes of memory loss and confusion, such as a thyroid disorder or vitamin levels that are too low.</p>
          <p class="para">Newer blood tests can measure levels of beta-amyloid protein and tau protein. But these tests aren't available everywhere and may not be covered by insurance.</p>

        <p class="para">Your healthcare professional may give you a brief mental status test to check your memory and other thinking skills. Longer forms of this type of test may provide more details about mental function that can be compared with people of a similar age and education level. These tests can help establish a diagnosis and serve as a starting point to track symptoms in the future.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">⦿ Brain Imaging</h2>
        <p class="para">Images of the brain look for visible changes related to conditions other than Alzheimer's disease that may cause similar symptoms, such as strokes, injury or tumors. Newer imaging tests can help detect specific brain changes caused by Alzheimer's disease, such as amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. These newer tests are mainly used in major medical centers or in clinical trials.</p>
        <ul>Imaging of brain structures include:
          <li class="li">Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI uses radio waves and a strong magnetic field to produce detailed images of the brain. They may show shrinkage of some brain regions linked to Alzheimer's disease. MRI scans also can rule out other conditions that may be causing symptoms. An MRI is generally preferred to a CT scan to evaluate dementia. MRIs also are done before starting certain Alzheimer's medicines and throughout treatment to monitor for potential side effects.</li>
          <li class="li">Computerized tomography (CT). A CT scan, a specialized X-ray technology, produces cross-sectional images of your brain. It's usually used to rule out tumors, strokes and head injuries</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>A PET scan test can capture images of the disease process. During a PET scan, a low-level radioactive tracer is injected into the blood to reveal a particular feature in the brain. PET imaging may include:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li class="li">Fluorodeoxyglucose, also called FDG, PET imaging scans show areas of the brain where nutrients aren't properly being used for energy, known as metabolism. Finding patterns in the areas of low metabolism can help distinguish between Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia.</li>
          <li class="li">Tau PET imaging measures neurofibrillary tangles in the brain.</li>
          <li class="li">Amyloid PET imaging can measure amyloid plaques in the brain. This test is mainly used in research but may be used if a person has unusual or very early onset of dementia symptoms.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Sometimes other tests may be used to measure amyloid and tau in the cerebrospinal fluid. This may be done if symptoms are quickly getting worse or if dementia is affecting someone at a younger age.</p>

    <div class="content-box treatment">
      <h1 class="heading">Treatment</h1>
      <p class="para">Treatments for Alzheimer's disease include medicines that can help with symptoms and newer medicines that can help slow decline in thinking and functioning. These newer medicines are approved for people with early Alzheimer's disease.</p>
      <h2>Medicine</h2>
      <h3>Alzheimer's medicines can help with memory symptoms and other cognitive changes. Two types of medicines used to treat symptoms include:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li class="li">Cholinesterase inhibitors. These medicines work by boosting levels of cell-to-cell communication. The medicines preserve a chemical messenger that is depleted in the brain by Alzheimer's disease. These are usually the first medicines tried, and most people see modest improvements in symptoms.</li>
        <li class="li">Memantine (Namenda). This medicine works in another brain cell communication network and slows the progression of symptoms with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. It's sometimes used in combination with a cholinesterase inhibitor. Relatively rare side effects include dizziness and confusion.</li>
        <li class="li">Lecanemab-irmb (Leqembi). This medicine is given as an IV infusion every two weeks. Side effects may include infusion-related reactions such as fever, flu-like symptoms, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, changes in heart rate and trouble breathing.</li>
        <li class="li">Donanemab-azbt (Kisunla). This medicine is given as an IV infusion every four weeks. Side effects may include flu-like symptoms, nausea, vomiting, headache, trouble breathing and changes in blood pressure.</li>
      </ul>
